# Hair Salon

#### By **Ann Munyare**

## Description

This is a web application for a hair salon where the user can add a list of stylists, and for each stylist, add clients who see that stylist. The stylists work independently, so each client only belongs to a single stylist.


## Setup / Installation Requirements

You will need [gradle](https://gradle.org/gradle-download/) and Postgres installed on your device.

Enter the following commands in your terminal:
* `git clone https://github.com/sheenanick/java-hair-salon` to clone this repository
* `postgres` to start the Postgres server
* `gradle run` to run the application

View http://localhost:4567 in a web browser of your choice.

In PSQL:
* `CREATE DATABASE hair_salon;`

* `CREATE TABLE clients (id serial PRIMARY KEY, firstname varchar, lastname varchar, notes varchar, stylistid integer);`
